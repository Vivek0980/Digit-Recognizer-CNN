“Kaggle notebook on CNN-based digit recognition with 91% accuracy”

# 🧠 Digit Classifier from Scratch (91.41% Accuracy)

This project demonstrates handwritten digit classification using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built from scratch using Python and TensorFlow/Keras. The model was trained and evaluated on the **Kaggle Digit Recognizer (MNIST)** dataset.

---

## 🚀 Highlights

- ✅ **Model**: CNN (Custom architecture)
- ✅ **Dataset**: MNIST (28x28 grayscale digit images)
- ✅ **Achieved Accuracy**: 91.41% on Kaggle submission
- ✅ **From Scratch**: No pretrained models used
